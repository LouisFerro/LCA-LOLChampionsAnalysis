## League Champions
The video League of Legends features playable characters called champions. Players use these champions to fight against each other in 5 vs 5 battles.
Before the game begins players first ban champions they don't want to see and then select their preferred champions. These decisions are saved in ban rate and popularity respectively.
Winrate is the measure of how many games are won with the champion on the team

## Questions
### How well can you predict ban rate via popularity and winrate?
